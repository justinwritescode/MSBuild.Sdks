# UsingsSdk

This SDK provides a way to add reusable `using` statements to your project files, packaged as a NuGet package.

## Usage

Simply create a project file with the `usings` you want to reuse and target the `UsingsSdk.`  Then, package the project as a NuGet package and reference it in your other projects.

### Example

#### `MyUsingsPackage.usings`

The target framework is implicitly defined as `netstandard2.0` and the `UsingsSdk` is implicitly referenced.

The package ID is generated as the project name `.Usings.`

```xml
<Project Sdk="UsingsSdk/0.0.1">
  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="System.Text" />
    <Using Include="System.Text.RegularExpressions" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

#### `.csproj` Project File

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="MyUsingsPackage.Usings" Version="1.0.0" />
    <!-- Implicitly Includes the following: -->
    <Using Include="System.Text" />
    <Using Include="System.Text.RegularExpressions" />
    <!-- Implicitly includes the above -->
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

#### Generated *.GlobalUsings.g.cs

```csharp
// <auto-generated/>
// ...
global using global::System.Text;
global using global::System.Text.RegularExpressions;
```

This is useful if you want to declare a set of `using` statements that are used in multiple projects, but you don't want to have to add them to every project file.
